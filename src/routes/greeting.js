        <h1>Hi Stirlo!</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to your website! This is all yours now, as far as the eye can see.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change anything you want. You could make this a portfolio page, or a
          public toilet review app, or a static picture of a tree. This is your playground,
          a place you can practice programming and have it be live on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've set this website up with a domain name (stirlo.com, provided by godaddy) and
          a hosting service (netlify). Netlify is actually really cool and the setup was super
          easy. All you need to do to update your website LIVE is push a new commit to main
          branch.
